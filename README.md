catnews
=======

I wrote this python script to replace images in the tweets with cat pictures.

Usage
=======

<code> python catnews.py <i>handle count</i> </code> 

This would read the given number of tweets (count) from the given handle and if the tweets have an image embedded, would replace it with a random cat image.

Subsequent runs would read the tweets from the last read tweet.
